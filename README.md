# oxideav-theora

Pure-Rust Theora video decoder — clean-room implementation, in
progress. The crate decodes Theora packets directly (it does not parse
the Ogg container); callers de-frame the bitstream packets and hand them
in. There is no encoder yet.

## What works

The decode pipeline is wired end-to-end at the packet level. For the
supported feature set the decoder reconstructs frames **sample-exactly**
against reference output.

* **Headers** — identification (`decode_identification_header`), comment
  (`parse_comment_header`), and setup (`parse_setup_header` /
  `decode_setup_header`, including loop-filter limits, quantisation
  parameters, and the DCT-token Huffman tables).
* **Frame header & bitstream** — frame header decode, coded-block flags,
  macroblock modes, motion-vector decode (zero-MV and explicit per-block
  MV with the half-pixel / quarter-pixel split), block-level `qi`
  selection, EOB and coefficient tokens, and full DCT coefficient
  decode.
* **Reconstruction** — DC prediction and inversion, the inverse DCT
  (DC-only shortcut plus the full two-pass path), intra and
  motion-compensated inter reconstruction, the complete frame-level
  reconstruction driver, and reference-frame promotion.
* **Loop filter** — the edge primitives, `lflim()` response, and the
  complete raster-order loop-filter driver (applied in place; collapses
  to identity at a zero filter limit).
* **Display crop** — `crop_frame_to_picture_region` (and the
  `FrameDecoder::crop_for_display` wrapper) crops the macroblock-aligned
  reconstruction down to the picture region, with the spec's chroma-axis
  rounding for all three pixel formats.

`FrameDecoder::decode_frame` chains the per-packet path
(header → block decode → reconstruction → in-place loop filter →
reference promotion) and is the high-level entry point. Empty (zero-byte)
packets are handled as duplicate-frame markers.

* **Framework `Decoder` integration** — `TheoraDecoder` implements
  `oxideav_core::Decoder`, and `register` installs it into a
  `RuntimeContext` (reachable through the shared `CodecRegistry`). Packets
  are dispatched by their §6.1 type bit: header packets (`0x80` / `0x81`
  / `0x82`) advance header collection, video-data packets are decoded,
  §2.2-cropped to the picture region, and flipped to top-down raster as
  an `oxideav_core::VideoFrame`. Headers may arrive inline as leading
  stream packets, via `TheoraDecoder::with_headers`, or as a
  length-prefixed `CodecParameters::extradata` chain parsed by the
  `make_decoder` factory.

End-to-end fixtures decoded sample-exactly cover intra-only streams,
intra-then-inter sequences, explicit motion vectors, custom quantisation
tables, weakest- and strongest-quantiser streams, non-MB-aligned picture
regions, a single-frame bitstream-version-3.2.1 (alpha3+) stream, and a
sustained multi-frame keyframe-interval run.

## Not yet supported

* **Ogg container parsing** — out of scope here; packets are supplied
  pre-de-framed by the caller.
* **Encoder** — none. The forward DCT (non-normative in the spec) is
  deferred to a future encoder-side effort.
* **Golden-reference and four-MV inter modes** (`INTER_GOLDEN_MV` /
  `INTER_MV_FOUR`) — implemented in the reconstruction code paths but
  not yet exercised end-to-end by the fixture corpus (no corpus fixture
  emits a golden or four-MV macroblock mode).
* **Framework `Encoder` trait integration** — there is no encoder, so
  no `oxideav_core::Encoder` impl. The decoder side is wired (see
  above).

## Usage

```rust
use oxideav_theora::{decode_identification_header, decode_setup_header, FrameDecoder};

// `ident_packet`, `setup_packet`, and the data packets are de-framed
// from the container by the caller.
let ident = decode_identification_header(ident_packet)?;
let setup = decode_setup_header(setup_packet)?;
let mut dec = FrameDecoder::new(ident, setup)?;
let frame = dec.decode_frame(data_packet)?;
let display = dec.crop_for_display(&frame)?;
# Ok::<(), oxideav_theora::Error>(())
```

Alternatively, drive the decoder through the `oxideav_core::Decoder`
trait. `TheoraDecoder` accepts the three §6 header packets (inline, via
`with_headers`, or as a length-prefixed `extradata` chain) and then
emits a top-down `VideoFrame` per video-data packet:

```rust
use oxideav_core::{CodecId, Decoder, Packet, TimeBase};
use oxideav_theora::{TheoraDecoder, THEORA_CODEC_ID};

# fn run(ident: &[u8], setup: &[u8], data: &[u8]) -> oxideav_core::Result<()> {
let mut dec = TheoraDecoder::with_headers(
    CodecId::new(THEORA_CODEC_ID),
    &[ident, setup],
)
.map_err(|e| oxideav_core::Error::invalid(e.to_string()))?;
dec.send_packet(&Packet::new(0, TimeBase::from_rate(1), data.to_vec()))?;
let _frame = dec.receive_frame()?; // Frame::Video, top-down planes
# Ok(())
# }
```

## Clean-room sources

Only the published Theora I Specification (`docs/video/theora/`), the
staged §6.4.1 procedure body transcribed from the specification's own
source for the section the PDF omits, and the fixture corpus under
`docs/video/theora/fixtures/` are consulted. Reference binaries are used
only as opaque black-box validators.
